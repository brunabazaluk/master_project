The diagram should simply consist of edges denoted in 'var1 -> var2' format, separated by commas. Step 2) Determine the query type: Identify the type of query implied by the main question. Choices include 'marginal probability', 'conditional probability', 'explaining away effect', 'backdoor adjustment set', 'average treatment effect', 'collider bias', 'normal counterfactual question', 'average treatment effect on treated', 'natural direct effect' or 'natural indirect effect'. Your answer should only be a term from the list above, enclosed in quotation marks. Step 3) Formalize the query: Translate the query into its formal mathematical expression based on its type, utilizing the 'do(Â·)' notation or counterfactual notations as needed.\\nQuestion: We know that zuph and jyka causes glimx.
