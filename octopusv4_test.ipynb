Use X to represent husband. Use V2 to represent wife. Use Y to represent alarm clock. The diagram should simply consist of edges denoted in 'var1 -&gt; var2' format, separated by commas. Step 2) Determine the query type: Identify the type of query implied by the main question. Choices include 'marginal probability', 'conditional probability', 'explaining away effect', 'backdoor adjustment set', 'average treatment effect', 'collider bias', 'normal counterfactual question', 'average treatment effect on treated', 'natural direct effect' or 'natural indirect effect'. Your answer should only be a term from the list above, enclosed in quotation marks. Step 3) Extract all the available data.

       "      <td>Question: We know that zuph or jyka causes glimx. We observed an individual is jyka.Would an individual is glimx if not zuph instead of zuph?Guidance: Address the question by following the steps below:\\nStep 1) Extract the causal graph: Identify the causal graph that depicts the relationships in the scenario. Use V2 to represent jyka. Use X to represent zuph. Use Y to represent glimx. The diagram should simply consist of edges denoted in 'var1 -&gt; var2' format, separated by commas. Step 2) Determine the query type: Identify the type of query implied by the main question. Choices include 'marginal probability', 'conditional probability', 'explaining away effect', 'backdoor adjustment set', 'average treatment effect', 'collider bias', 'normal counterfactual question', 'average treatment effect on treated', 'natural direct effect' or 'natural indirect effect'. Your answer should only be a term from the list above, enclosed in quotation marks. Step 3) Extract all the available data. Your answer should contain nothing but marginal probabilities and conditional probabilities in the form 'P(...)=...' or 'P(...|...)=...', each probability being separated by a semicolon. Stick to the previously mentioned denotations for the variables.</td>\n",

For husbands that don't set the alarm and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 54%. For husbands that set the alarm and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 41%. For husbands that set the alarm and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 86%. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of alarm set by wife is 74%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of alarm set by wife is 24%.If we disregard the mediation effect through wife, would husband positively affect alarm clock?Guidance: Address the question by following the steps below:\\nStep 1) Extract the causal graph: Identify the causal graph that depicts the relationships in the scenario. Use X to represent husband. Use V2 to represent wife. Use Y to represent alarm clock. The diagram should simply consist of edges denoted in 'var1 -> var2' format, separated by commas. Step 2) Determine the query type: Identify the type of query implied by the main question. Choices include 'marginal probability', 'conditional probability', 'explaining away effect', 'backdoor adjustment set', 'average treatment effect', 'collider bias', 'normal counterfactual question', 'average treatment effect on treated', 'natural direct effect' or 'natural indirect effect'. Your answer should only be a term from the list above, enclosed in quotation marks. Step 3) Extract all the available data. Your answer should contain nothing but marginal probabilities and conditional probabilities in the form 'P(...)=...' or 'P(...|...)=...', each probability being separated by a semicolon.

       "4                                            Question: For husbands that don't set the alarm and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 11%. For husbands that don't set the alarm and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 60%. For husbands that set the alarm and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 46%. For husbands that set the alarm and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 92%. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of alarm set by wife is 61%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of alarm set by wife is 1%.Does husband positively affect alarm clock through wife?Guidance: Address the question by following the steps below:\\nStep 1) Extract the causal graph: Identify the causal graph that depicts the relationships in the scenario.

We observed an individual is jyka.Would an individual is not glimx if zuph instead of not zuph?Guidance: Address the question by following the steps below:\\nStep 1) Extract the causal graph: Identify the causal graph that depicts the relationships in the scenario. Use V2 to represent jyka. Use X to represent zuph. Use Y to represent glimx. The diagram should simply consist of edges denoted in 'var1 -> var2' format, separated by commas. Step 2) Determine the query type: Identify the type of query implied by the main question. Choices include 'marginal probability', 'conditional probability', 'explaining away effect', 'backdoor adjustment set', 'average treatment effect', 'collider bias', 'normal counterfactual question', 'average treatment effect on treated', 'natural direct effect' or 'natural indirect effect'. Your answer should only be a term from the list above, enclosed in quotation marks. Step 3) Extract all the available data. Your answer should contain nothing but marginal probabilities and conditional probabilities in the form 'P(...)=...' or 'P(...|...)=...', each probability being separated by a semicolon.

For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of alarm set by wife is 24%.If we disregard the mediation effect through wife, would husband positively affect alarm clock?Guidance: Address the question by following the steps below:\\nStep 1) Extract the causal graph: Identify the causal graph that depicts the relationships in the scenario. Use X to represent husband. Use V2 to represent wife. Use Y to represent alarm clock. The diagram should simply consist of edges denoted in 'var1 -> var2' format, separated by commas. Step 2) Determine the query type: Identify the type of query implied by the main question. Choices include 'marginal probability', 'conditional probability', 'explaining away effect', 'backdoor adjustment set', 'average treatment effect', 'collider bias', 'normal counterfactual question', 'average treatment effect on treated', 'natural direct effect' or 'natural indirect effect'. Your answer should only be a term from the list above, enclosed in quotation marks. Step 3) Extract all the available data. Your answer should contain nothing but marginal probabilities and conditional probabilities in the form 'P(...)=...' or 'P(...|...)=...', each probability being separated by a semicolon. Stick to the previously mentioned denotations for the variables. \n",
